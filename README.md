# Rock Paper Scissors Game Website

This GitHub repository houses a personal project developed as part of The Odin Project curriculum. It is a web-based implementation of the classic game "Rock, Paper, Scissors." The project aims to showcase my skills in web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The website provides a user-friendly interface where players can compete against a computer opponent in multiple rounds of Rock, Paper, Scissors. The game follows the traditional rules, allowing players to select their choice of rock, paper, or scissors, and the computer generates its move randomly.

The repository contains all the necessary code files and assets required to run the game. It includes HTML files that define the structure and layout of the web pages, CSS files for styling and visual enhancements, and JavaScript files responsible for the game logic and user interactions.
